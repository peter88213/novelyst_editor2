# novelyst_editor

A simple [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) scene editor plugin based on the *tkinter.scrolledtext* widget.

Edit the selected scene, if the project is not locked.

For more information, see the [project homepage](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst_editor) with description and download instructions.

## Development

- The plugin uses the **TextBox** subclass of the [tkinter text widget](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/text.html).
- To enhance the editor's capabilities, modify the **TextBox** class.
- An example for an enhanced text box is the Rich Text editor by Bryan Oakley on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63099026/fomatted-text-in-tkinter).
